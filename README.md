# Eye Candy Cinema

This website was an assignment for my Diploma in Software Development at Whitecliffe technology and innovation 2021. 

This project was for the Data Handling and Web Concepts and the purpose of the site was to generate interest of movies shown at the cinema and to sell tickets.

The web project was first planned and then designed with wireframes.

The whole website was built with only HTML and CSS and it was to be a static website with no back-end.
